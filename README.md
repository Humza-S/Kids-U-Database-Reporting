Kids-U Database Refresh

# kidsuDB: Kids-U Database Refresh:



## Description:

The goal of this project is the refresh the Kids-U staff website and the database system, with new features. 
Because we were unable to get the source code for the current website, we have started rebuilding the website from scratch. 

### Framework:

The current website is being hosted by [Everleap](https://www.everleap.com), which supports web applications written using the ASP.NET framework. To ensure that Kids-U can continue using this hosting service, we are using ASP.NET MVC.

### Database:

We originally attempted to use MySQL for our database, but ran into issues connecting the database with our project on Visual Studio. We have switched over to Microsoft SQL Server. So far, things appear to me moving more smoothly.

### Other Software:

- Visual Studio for ASP.NET MVC
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Microsoft Windows (We've had issues with MacOS)



## Requirements:

### Rebuilding:

- Replicated front-end UI
- Database w/ information for student, staff, schools, sites, etc.
- Ability to add new students and other data to database
- Ability to view basic table of information on each page
- Ability to export CSV files of information

### Search/Filter/Sort:

- Ability to search for students by name on relevant pages
- Advanced Search feature to filter the list of students based on certain information
- Sort-by feature that allows the list of students to be ordered based on certain information
- Ability to export CSV files of sorted/filtered results

### Progress Reporting:

- Long-term academic tracking system for students
- Ability to generate a student progress report based on accumulated data
- Ability to sort/search/filter students based on progress report results



## Progress:

### So far we have:

- Replicated the front end design for most of the pages of the current website. Some additional pages may be missing (e.g. edit interface). The front end is currently not dynamic, so the code will need to be adjusted to display the correct information from the database. 
- Began rebuilding the database and filling the database with dummy data.
- Began connecting the database to the project.

### To-Do:

- Add ability to add new students and other data to database
- Add ability to view information on each page
- Add ability to export CSV files of information
- Implement search feature
- Implement advanced searching
- Implement sorting
- Implement long-term academic tracking system for students
- Add ability to generate student progress reports
- Implement sort/search/filter functionality for progress report results
- Figure out deployment and hosting situation



## Overview of [Current Site](http://staff.kids-u.org):

### Login and Entry Portal:

- Nothing really special about the login page. We have added a temp button on our working revision to bypass the login for testing purposes. 
- The entry portal serves as a directory linking to all the other web pages. The navigation bar at the top of the page is shared on all the other pages. We have removed it from the login page on our revision because it serves no purpose on that page. We have also removed the attendance button from the navigation bar, because Kids-U no longer uses that page.

### Data Entry:

- The **enrollment** page displays all the student roster in a table.
- The **outcome measurements** page displays results of tests designed to measure student growth. The information displayed on this page was lost somehow previously, so the pages are currently empty.
- The **report cards** page displays report card grades of the students. Also, the information displayed on this page was also lost.
- The **attendance/meals** page has been removed because Kids-U not longer uses that page.

### Management:

- The **staff directory** page displays the staff roster in a table, along with a staff entry for each Kids-U site.
- The **program/facility sites** page displays a list of Kids-U sites.
- The **organizations** page displays a list of organizations associated with Kids-U.
- The **school districts** page displays a list of school districts that students attend. 
- The **schools** page displays a list of schools that students attend.

### Notes:

- We have replaced the create new and export buttons on each page with our new function bar in our revision. This function bar has new create new and export buttons, along with a sort-by dropdown, search bar, and advanced search menu.
- All of the pages have a details options that displays all the information on the entry on a separate page. It might be beneficial to remove the details option and display all the information on the primary table to avoid unnecessary complications and issues with sorting and searching by information that is not displayed. 



## Overview of Current Project:

### Code:

- **App_Start folder:** This folder contains RouteConfig.cs, which is used for communication with the browser.
- **Content folder:** This folder contains all the CSS and images used for the project. Currently we have 1 image used on the home page and 1 CSS file that we wrote that applies to all our pages (Site.css). The bootstrap CSS files were included with bootstrap.
- **Controllers folder:** This folder contains the controllers for the project. The controllers are basically classes that manage user interaction and flow control logic in MVC applications.
- **Scripts folder:** This folder contains all the Javascript for the project. Site.js is the only Javascript file we have written so far, everything else was added either by default or from other packages.
- **Views folder:** The folder contains the CSHTML files for the project. Each folder corresponds to a controller. The CSHTML files are similar to HTML with some small differences (e.g. linking between pages).
- **bin folder:** This folder contains compiled assemblies. You probably won't have to touch this folder unless something goes terribly wrong.
- **packages folder:** This folder contains the installed packages. You probably won't have to deal with this folder either.

- **.gitignore:** List of files and directories to be excluded when pushing to GitHub. These files all seem to contain local meta-data, so they were excluded to avoid merge conflicts. 
- **Global.asax & Global.asax.cs:** Handles application level events. We haven't needed to touch these files yet.
- **Web.config:** Contains the ASP.NET configuration settings that override settings in the Machine.config file, which exists somewhere on your local machine. A Web.config file also exists within the Views folder. I have had to edit these files a few times to fix errors that occurred after updating Visual Studios or certain packages (on MacOS).
- **packages.config:** Contains configuration settings for installed packages.
- **test.csproj & test.sln:** Contains information regarding the project and solution.
