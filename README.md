# kidsuDB: Kids-U Database Refresh:



## Description:

The goal of this project is the refresh the Kids-U staff website and the database system, with new features. 
Because we were unable to get the source code for the current website, we have started rebuilding the website from scratch. 

### Framework:

The current website is being hosted by [Everleap](https://www.everleap.com), which supports web applications written using the ASP.NET framework. To ensure that Kids-U can continue using this hosting service, we are using ASP.NET MVC.

### Database:

We originally attempted to use MySQL for our database, but ran into issues connecting the database with our project on Visual Studio. We have switched over to Microsoft SQL Server. So far, things appear to me moving more smoothly.

### Other Software:

Visual Studio for ASP.NET MVC
Microsoft SQL Server
Microsoft Windows (We've had issues with MacOS)



## Requirements:

### Rebuilding:

- Replicated front-end UI
- Database w/ information for student, staff, schools, sites, etc.
- Ability to add new students and other data to database
- Ability to view basic table of information on each page
- Ability to export CSV files of information

### Search/Filter/Sort:

- Ability to search for students by name on relevant pages
- Advanced Search feature to filter the list of students based on certain information
- Sort-by feature that allows the list of students to be ordered based on certain information
- Ability to export CSV files of sorted/filtered results

### Progress Reporting:

- Long-term academic tracking system for students
- Ability to generate a student progress report based on accumulated data
- Ability to sort/search/filter students based on progress report results



## Progress:

### So far we have:

- Replicated the front end design for most of the pages of the current website. Some additional pages may be missing (e.g. edit interface). The front end is currently not dynamic, so the code will need to be adjusted to display the correct information from the database. 
- Began rebuilding the database and filling the database with dummy data.
- Began connecting the database to the project.

### To-Do:

- Add ability to add new students and other data to database
- Add ability to view information on each page
- Add ability to export CSV files of information
- Implement search feature
- Implement advanced searching
- Implement sorting
- Implement long-term academic tracking system for students
- Add ability to generate student progress reports
- Implement sort/search/filter functionality for progress report results



## Overview of [Current Site](http://staff.kids-u.org):

### Login and Entry Portal:

- Nothing really special about the login page. We have added a temp button on our working revision to bypass the login for testing purposes. 
- The entry portal serves as a directory linking to all the other web pages. The navigation bar at the top of the page is shared on all the other pages. We have removed it from the login page on our revision because it serves no purpose on that page. We have also removed the attendance button from the navigation bar, because Kids-U no longer uses that page.

### Data Entry:

- The enrollment page displays all the student roster in a table.
- The outcome measurements and report cards pages display academic results of the students. We're not sure what the distinction between them is. Also, the information displayed on those pages had been previously lost somehow, so the pages are empty and unused for now. 
- The attendance/meals page has been removed because Kids-U not longer uses that page.

### Management:

- The staff directory page displays the staff roster in a table, along with a staff entry for each Kids-U site.
- The program/facility sites page displays a list of Kids-U sites.
- The organizations page displays a list of organizations that support Kids-U.
- The school districts page displays a list of school districts that students attend. 
- The schools page displays a list of schools that students attend.

### Notes:

- We have replaced the create new and export buttons on each page with our new function bar in our revision. This function bar has new create new and export buttons, along with a sort-by dropdown, search bar, and advanced search menu.
- All of the pages have a details options that displays all the information on the entry on a separate page. It might be beneficial to remove the details option and display all the information on the primary table to avoid unnecessary complications and issues with sorting and searching by information that is not displayed.
